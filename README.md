# Stock-Market-Analysis

This project delves into the realm of financial analysis and predictive modeling using Python. It starts by fetching historical stock data for prominent technology companies such as Intel, Tesla, Netflix, and Oracle. Through comprehensive data visualization techniques, including plotting closing prices, moving averages, and daily returns, the project offers insights into each stock's performance over time.

Furthermore, it explores the interrelation between these stocks by analyzing correlation matrices of both closing prices and daily returns. By quantifying risk, it provides investors with a clearer understanding of the potential risks associated with each stock. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to simulate thousands of possible future price paths, aiding in constructing a more informed investment strategy.

In a predictive capacity, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model is trained to forecast future stock prices, with a focus on Tesla's stock. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, the model generates predictions that can assist investors in anticipating future market trends and making data-driven decisions. Overall, this project combines financial analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling to empower investors with actionable insights into the dynamic world of stock markets.
